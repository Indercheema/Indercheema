## About Me

I’m Inderjeet Sing Cheema. I was born in Punjab, India. I have been attached to technology
since my childhood. I finished my secondary education back in 2014 but I won’t get any 
practical experience with computers or programming. In 2015, I went to New Zealand for 
Computer diploma and got various hand on knowledge about computer software, hardware, 
and networking. I was awarded a scholarship for great performance throughout the year.

Now, I am studying the Software Developer Program at the Manitoba Institute of Trades and Technology.
I have gained practical experience coding HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I love to develop new design
Websites using CSS and JavaScript.
