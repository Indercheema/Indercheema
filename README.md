## About Me

I’m Inderjeet Sing Cheema. I was born in Punjab, India. I have been attached to technology
since my childhood. I finished my secondary education back in 2014 but I won’t get any 
practical experience with computers or programming. In 2015, I went to New Zealand for 
Computer diploma and got various hand on knowledge about computer software, hardware, 
and networking. I was awarded a scholarship for great performance throughout the year.

I worked for one New Zealand company as an ICT support technician to get international 
experience and use my skills. I was handling all the technology-related job duties including 
maintaining systems, maintaining and updating the website, online email queries, and updating 
inventory.
